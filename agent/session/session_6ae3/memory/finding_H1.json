    "hypothesis": "Checkout flow bug disproportionately impacts web platform, reducing its conversion rate and dragging down overall platform conversion rate",
    "causal_history": "The product team released a new checkout flow on December 16th. If this new checkout has a bug or UX issue on the web platform specifically, users attempting to complete purchases on web would abandon at higher rates. Since web likely represents a significant portion of traffic, this could explain the 15.8% relative decrease in overall conversion rate starting December 17th.",

    "summary_of_analysis_performed": "Iteration 1: Analyzed overall conversion rates by platform (web, iOS, Android) comparing baseline period (Dec 10-16) vs anomaly period (Dec 17-24). Found that web conversion rate remained stable at 5.38% in both periods (0.03% change), while iOS conversion dropped dramatically from 4.89% to 2.17% (-55.51% relative change) and Android dropped from 4.45% to 3.99% (-10.37% relative change). The overall conversion rate drop from 5.01% to 3.97% (15.8% relative decrease matching user's report) was driven by iOS and Android, not web. Iteration 2: Confirmed findings by analyzing conversion rates by platform AND product category. Web remained stable across all four categories (electronics, fashion, home, groceries) with average change of only +0.14%. iOS showed consistent massive drops across all categories averaging -55.53%. Android showed consistent moderate drops averaging -10.57%. This categorical consistency demonstrates that the web platform was completely unaffected by the checkout flow change, while iOS was severely impacted and Android moderately impacted across all product segments.",

Web contributed 44.2% of baseline sessions but maintained stable conversion. iOS contributed 33.3% of baseline sessions but dropped 55.51%. Android contributed 22.5% of baseline sessions and dropped 10.37%. The weighted impact of iOS's severe drop and Android's moderate drop explains the overall decline."

The actual data shows the opposite: web was not impacted at all (0.03% change), iOS was devastated (-55.51% change), and Android was moderately impacted (-10.37% change). The pattern is consistent and systematic across all product categories, indicating a platform-specific technical issue rather than a product category issue."
