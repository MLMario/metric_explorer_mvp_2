  "hypothesis": "Checkout flow bug is triggered by specific product categories (electronics or fashion), causing users in those high-traffic categories to abandon checkout",
  "causal_history": "The new checkout flow released on December 16th may have compatibility issues with specific product types or may have changed category-specific flows. If electronics and fashion categories (likely high-traffic categories during holiday shopping) are experiencing increased checkout abandonment due to the bug, their conversion rates would drop. If these categories represent a material portion of overall traffic, the weighted average conversion rate would decline starting December 17th.",

  "summary_of_analysis_performed": "Iteration 1: Analyzed conversion rate changes by category (electronics, fashion, home, groceries) comparing baseline period (Dec 10-16) vs anomaly period (Dec 17-24). Found all categories declined uniformly at approximately 20% (electronics: -19.88%, fashion: -20.67%, home: -21.46%, groceries: -20.42%), with no meaningful differential impact on the hypothesis target categories. Iteration 2: Examined traffic volume for electronics and fashion categories, confirming they represent 59.4% of baseline sessions and 59.5% of anomaly sessions - making them high-traffic as predicted. However, despite this material traffic share, their conversion rate decline (-20.28% average) is virtually identical to other categories (-20.94% average), contradicting the hypothesis. Removing these categories from overall metric actually slightly increases the decline magnitude (-20.80% vs -20.63% overall), opposite of what would be expected if they were experiencing category-specific bugs. Iteration 3: Segmented analysis by device platform (web, iOS, Android) to identify if category-specific effects exist within platforms. Discovered the actual pattern is PLATFORM-SPECIFIC, not category-specific: Web platforms show minimal decline (0-2%), iOS shows catastrophic decline across all categories (~55%), Android shows moderate decline (~10%). All categories decline equally within each platform, indicating a universal checkout bug rather than category-specific issues. Iteration 4: Comprehensive validation confirming electronics and fashion show no differential impact compared to home and groceries across any platform or aggregation level, directly contradicting H3's causal mechanism.",

      "evidence": "Overall decline (all categories): -20.63%. Decline without electronics/fashion: -20.80%. The 0.17 percentage point increase indicates electronics/fashion are actually experiencing LESS severe impact than other categories, opposite of hypothesis prediction."
