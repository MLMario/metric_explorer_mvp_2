  "hypothesis_id": "H4",
  "hypothesis": "Mobile platforms (iOS and Android combined) experience disproportionate checkout flow issues, reducing their conversion rates and pulling down overall platform performance",
  "causal_history": "Mobile checkout experiences are often more fragile due to screen size constraints and interaction differences. If the new checkout flow released on December 16th has platform-specific rendering issues, timeout problems, or touch-interaction bugs that primarily affect mobile users, their conversion rates would decline sharply. During the holiday shopping season, mobile often represents a significant share of traffic, so a mobile-specific checkout issue could cause a notable overall conversion rate decline starting December 17th.",

  "summary_of_analysis_performed": "Iteration 1: Compared overall conversion rates by device type (web, iOS, Android) for baseline vs anomaly periods. Found web flat (+0.03%), iOS severely down (-55.51%), Android moderately down (-10.37%). Iteration 2: Detailed breakdown with absolute numbers showed iOS lost 1,026 orders despite gaining 8,338 sessions, indicating a severe per-session conversion collapse. Android showed more modest decline. Iteration 3: Daily trend analysis showed iOS consistently underperforming web on every single day (Dec 17-24), with zero exceptions. Pattern is stable at 2.17% daily avg vs web 5.38% avg. Iteration 4: Cross-dimensional analysis confirmed mobile impact is NOT category or user-type specific\u2014iOS consistently dropped -55% across all 4 product categories and both new/returning user types, strongly suggesting a platform-level issue rather than category-specific problem.",
